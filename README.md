A sleek and interactive **To-Do List Application** built with **React**. This application allows users to manage their tasks, reorder them, and toggle between **grid** and **list views**. The tasks are persisted using **localStorage** so that your data stays intact across sessions.

## Features

- **Add and Delete Tasks**: Seamlessly manage tasks with a clean user interface. Tasks can be added and deleted as required. For deletion double-click on the task.
- **Toggle Between Grid and List Views**: Switch the layout using the toggle button in the middle of the task list.
- **Reorder Tasks with Drag-and-Drop**: Drag tasks to reorder them according to priority or personal preference.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are stored in the browser using `localStorage`, meaning they persist across page reloads.
- **Dark Mode**: The application features a modern, dark theme with stylish gradients.
